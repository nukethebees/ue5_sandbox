# Sandbox Unreal Engine Project

This repository is a Sandbox for me to learn UE5.

## Custom Plugins

The project utilizes a custom plugin to extend the engine's capabilities:

*   **USF Loader**: Located in `Plugins/USFLoader/`, it allows you to inject `.usf/.ush` files into materials to call HLSL functions within custom material nodes.
